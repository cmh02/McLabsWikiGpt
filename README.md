# MCLabs Wiki RAG

##### ðŸš§ Work in Progress: This project is currently under active development!

Welcome to the [MCLabs](https://labs-mc.com/) (often shortened to MCL) Wiki RAG!

This tool will implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to support prompting [Google Gemini ](https://gemini.google.com/app)with specific context relative to our minecraft server from the [community wiki](https://labs-mc.com/wiki/Main_Page). It will then offer an API for using the system via HTTP requests.

## Features

* Fetches and chunks [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API) articles automatically
* Embeds content using [Google Gemini embeddings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings)
* Stores vectors in a [FAISS index](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Faiss-indexes) for fast similarity search
* Lightweight [Flask API](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) served with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) for production-ready handling of RAG queries
* Rate-limited API calls to handle [Google Gemini API restrictions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)
* Uses [Google Gemini&#39;s 2.5 Flash Lite](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) as the generative language model

## Deployment

This project currently has two user interfaces:

* A minecraft in-game command built using [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)
* A custom [Discord](https://discord.com/) application that is available in our community server

For the backend, I have created two [Railway](https://railway.com/) projects from the GitHub Repository:

* The first project handles the backend API
* The second project provides the discord bot
